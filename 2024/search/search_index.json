Welcome to my detailed exploration of the 2024 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! This year's event, themed \"Snow-maggedon,\" offers an immersive adventure where participants sharpen their cybersecurity skills through engaging real-world challenges set in a whimsical holiday environment.</p> <p>This year's festive challenge unfolds through a Prologue and three Acts, each introducing new challenges and advancing the storyline:</p> <ul> <li>Prologue: Launched on November 7, 2024</li> <li>Act 1: Released on November 11, 2024</li> <li>Act 2: Scheduled for release on November 18, 2024</li> <li>Act 3: Scheduled for release on December 2, 2024</li> </ul> <p>Participants are encouraged to share solutions to the Prologue, Act 1, and Act 2 challenges starting once the next section has been released. However, for Act 3, players must wait until after the competition ends before sharing their answers or solutions.</p> <p>A heartfelt thank you to the SANS Institute and the entire Holiday Hack Challenge team for orchestrating this festive and educational event. Their dedication to fostering a global cybersecurity community through engaging and accessible challenges is truly commendable.</p> <p>This write-up aims to assist first-time participants, cybersecurity enthusiasts, seasoned professionals, and everyone in between. Whether you're seeking guidance on a particularly tricky challenge or exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity, I hope this resource provides valuable insights and support.</p> <p>Let's embark on this journey together, unraveling the mysteries of Snow-maggedon and enhancing our cybersecurity skills in the most festive way possible!</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>So far this write-up covers the just the objectives in the prologue. I shall include more content as I progress in the game and according to the sharing rules of the game.</p> <p>50-page submission limit</p> <p>Each year there's a huge number of write-ups that need to be reviewed by the Counter Hack team. To find a good middle ground between preventing information overload and creating a write-up that can stand on its own as a learning resource, some parts, like the navigation tip below, are collapsed by default. Skipping over these will not take away from understanding the overall solution, but feel free to expand them to get some additional information.</p> Navigation tip <p>Even with less than 50 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use P or , to go to the previous section, N or . to navigate to the next section, and S, F, or / to open up the search dialog.</p> <p>TL;DR if you keep pressing N or . from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! </p>"},{"location":"#answers","title":"Answers","text":""},{"location":"#prologue","title":"Prologue","text":"<p> 1.

And although we're on Frosty's Beach on Christmas Island, we'll soon be on our way back to the North Pole. I thought it best to wait here for people that heard we're on the Geese Islands but may not know we're leaving. I haven't seen Santa since we started packing up, but he always asks me to give a quick orientation to newcomers, so I'm continuing the tradition. Before you head out any further onto the island, you need to accomplish two simple tasks.</p> <p>But first, here's a parting gift. I packed this snowball made of the magical, never-melting snow of Christmas Island. A little souvenir to take with you when we leave for the North Pole.</p> <p>Click on the snowball on your avatar.

I'm Angel Candysalt \u2014 so happy to finally meet you! I'm thrilled you're here because I could really use a hand with something. Have you ever heard of a game called Connections? It\u2019s simple! All you need to do is find groups of four related words. I've been stuck on it all day, and I'm sure someone as sharp as you will breeze through it. Oh, and while you're at it, check out randomElf's score \u2014 they hit fifty thousand points, which seems\u2026 oddly suspicious. Think they might have tampered with the game?

Your goal here is to find groups of items that share something in common.

Group all the items correctly to win!</p> Elf Connect Hard <p>WOW! A high score of 50,000 points! That\u2019s way beyond the limit! With only four rounds and a max of 400 points per round, the top possible score should be 1,600 points. So, how did someone get to 50,000? Something unusual must be happening!</p> <p>If you're curious, you might want to check under the hood. Try opening the browser's developer tools console and looking around\u2014there might even be a variable named 'score' that could give you some insights.

We could do this programatically via the browser console to be able to get the expected answers. The information is contained in the website's javascript, which we can read and understand. To be able to see the group sets for each section, we can run the code \"Display Correct Sets\" available in the code block. An easier way is to run code \"Automatically Select and Submit Correct Groups\" which will automatically submit the correct sets and complete the round.</p> <p>Success!

Investigating the code, we can see that the script is just submiting an action with a value of 1, when the round is completed successfully, and a value of 2 when the high score is exceeded. There is nothing going to, or coming from the server that determines the high score. So all we need to do is set the score to 50,000 or more at the start of the game, and when we get the first matching set, we earn the gold trophy. </p> <p>Great Job Hacker!

For the most part, Elf Minder 9000 can be enjoyed without any hacking skills, offering a fun, festive experience. However, as the levels progress and challenges become more devious, a bit of holiday \"hacker magic\" might be just what you need to prevail. When the game becomes a real nutcracker, clever workarounds and some elven shenanigans are often the keys to success.</p> <p>Each level in Elf Minder 9000 has two scoreboards:</p> <ul> <li>Good Boss Mode     In this mode, players aim to finish the level with the least number of segments and in the shortest possible time. It rewards efficient and precise gameplay.</li> <li>Evil Boss Mode     This mode flips things on its head\u2014the goal is to take longer, pass through as many segments as possible, and make the fewest rotations. It's all about taking the scenic route and making the journey delightfully inefficient.</li> </ul> <p>Some of the more beginner-friendly levels, such as Sandy Start, Waves and Crates, Tidal Treasures, Dune Dash, Coral Cove, Shell Seekers, Palm Grove Shuffle, Tropical Tangle, and Crate Caper, can be completed without relying on any special tricks or hacks. They provide a great introduction for players of all skill levels.</p> <p>My eight-year-old daughter enjoyed playing Elf Minder 9000, and it was a joy to watch her enthusiasm grow. However, she quickly learned an important lesson\u2014sometimes, simply playing by the rules won\u2019t get you a place on the leaderboard!</p> <p>When we reached Shoreline Shuffle, it became clear that a bit of creative ingenuity was required. Digging into the code behind the scenes, we stumbled upon something interesting in guide.js. There was a constant called whyCantIHoldAllTheseSprings, which logs in the browser's console when the hero attempts to pass over three springs\u2014something that shouldn't be possible since the game only lets you use two springs by default. This clue led us to explore the game.entities.push() method, which, as it turns out, allows us to directly add objects into the game.</p> <p>With this newfound discovery, we realized we could place springs adjacent to boulders, a feat that regular gameplay mechanics would not normally permit. By leveraging these sneaky elven hacks, we successfully conquered Shoreline Shuffle. Here's what we ended up with for that level:</p> <p></p> <p>When passing the 3rd spring, we also saw this message in the browser console!</p> WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE SPRINGS?? <pre><code>                             WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE SPRINGS??\n\n                                            .--======-                                                          \n                                        --              --.                                                     \n                                    -=                     =:                                                  \n                                .=                         -

Limited to 1 request per 1 second.</p> <p>The message was clear: a rate-limit was in place, restricting requests from the same User-Agent to just one per second. I asked Chatty to revise the script, adding a touch of holiday ingenuity. We included five different User-Agent strings and had the script cycle through them, ensuring that each request used a different one. This allowed us to bring the delay down to 0.2 seconds between requests, effectively bypassing the rate limit without raising suspicion.</p> <p>With this improved approach, the script needed only 24 attempts to successfully uncover the correct code.

We will learn some basic curl commands while playing a round of curling.</p> <p>Are you ready to begin?</p> <p>1) Unlike the defined standards of a curling sheet, embedded devices often have web servers on non-standard ports.  Use curl to retrieve the web page on host \"curlingfun\" port 8080.</p> <pre><code>alabaster@curlingfun:~$ curl http://curlingfun:8080\nYou have successfully accessed the site on port 8080!\n</code></pre> <p>2) Embedded devices often use self-signed certificates, where your browser will not trust the certificate presented.  Use curl to retrieve the TLS-protected web page at https://curlingfun:9090/</p> <pre><code>alabaster@curlingfun:~$ curl -k https://curlingfun:9090\nYou have successfully bypassed the self-signed certificate warning!\nSubsequent requests will continue to require \"--insecure\", or \"-k\" for short.\n</code></pre> <p>3) Working with APIs and embedded devices often requires making HTTP POST requests. Use curl to send a request to https://curlingfun:9090/ with the parameter \"skip\" set to the value \"alabaster\", declaring Alabaster as the team captain.</p> <pre><code>alabaster@curlingfun:~$ curl -k -X POST -d \"skip=alabaster\" https://curlingfun:9090\nYou have successfully made a POST request!\n</code></pre> <p>4) Working with APIs and embedded devices often requires maintaining session state by passing a cookie.  Use curl to send a request to https://curlingfun:9090/ with a cookie called \"end\" with the value \"3\", indicating we're on the third end of the curling match.</p> <pre><code>alabaster@curlingfun:~$ curl -k -b \"end=3\" https://curlingfun:9090\nYou have successfully set a cookie!\n</code></pre> <p>5) Working with APIs and embedded devices sometimes requires working with raw HTTP headers.  Use curl to view the HTTP headers returned by a request to https://curlingfun:9090/</p> <pre><code>alabaster@curlingfun:~$ curl -k https://curlingfun:9090 -i\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:48:50 GMT\nContent-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nCustom-Header: You have found the custom header!\n\nYou have successfully bypassed the self-signed certificate warning!\nSubsequent requests will continue to require \"--insecure\", or \"-k\" for short.\n</code></pre> <p>6) Working with APIs and embedded devices sometimes requires working with custom HTTP headers.

The physical connectivity is quite straight forward, just connect RX to TX, TX to RX, VCC to V(Volt) and GND to G(Ground). The trouble is finding the serial settings, which I guess could be done manually by trial and error, but I wasn't going to take that approach. Looking at the Network Tab in the browser Development Tools, I could see the request being sent to the API which was the following:</p> <pre><code>{requestID: \"50a92e5e-8ee3-4f27-9e99-bb341751efa0\", serial: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], voltage: 3}\n</code></pre> <p>The response to this was False.

Uncompressing this file reveals a large number of small JPEG files, wall named with a unique ID. The challenge provides a tip that if we use the heuristic edge detection script, we should be able to identify the order of these files to stitch them back together. But, in the process of my investigation, I identified that the JPEG files where compressed in the order they were shreded. One can see this using a tool like zipnote or zipinfo against the shreds. This could be tested using the EXIF tool against each of these files in the order identified by these tools, to reveal a base64 comment, that when decoded, returns an array of 2 string, the first whcih liiks like some encoding string, which I have not figured out what it is (so far), while the second array contained groups of 2 or 3 ASCII character. I asked Chatty to come up with a script that gets the order from the shreds file itself, and then run EXIF on each, decode the base64, and combine the ASCII String. This is the story we descoverd:</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Long ago, in the snowy realm of the North Pole (not too far away if you're a reindeer), there existed a magical land ruled by a mysterious figure known as the Great Claus. Two spirited elves, Twinkle and Jangle, roamed this frosty kingdom, defending it from the perils of holiday cheerlessness. Twinkle, sporting a bright red helmet-shaped hat that tilted just so, was quick-witted and even quicker with a snowball. Jangle, a bit taller, wore a green scarf that drooped like a sleepy reindeers ears. Together, they were the Mistletoe Knights, the protectors of the magical land and the keepers of Claus peace. One festive morning, the Great Claus summoned them for a critical quest. 'Twinkle, Jangle, the time has come,' he announced with a voice that rumbled like thunder across the ice plains. 'The fabled Never-Melting Snowflake, a relic that grants one wish, lies hidden beyond the Peppermint Expanse. Retrieve it, and all marshmallow supplies will be secured!' Armed with Jangles handmade map (created with crayon and a lot of optimism), the duo set off aboard their toboggan, the Frostwing. However, the map led them in endless loops around the Reindeer Academy, much to the amusement of trainee reindeer perfecting their aerial maneuvers. Blitzen eventually intercepted them, chuckling, 'Lost, fellas? The snowflake isnt here. Try the Enchanted Peppermint Grove!' Twinkle facepalmed as Jangle pretended to adjust his map. With Blitzens directions, they zoomed off again, this time on the right course. The Peppermint Grove was alive with its usual enchantmentscandy cane trees swayed and sang ancient ballads of epic sleigh battles and the triumphs of Claus candy cane squadrons. Twinkle and Jangle joined the peppermint choir, their voices harmonizing with the festive tune. Hours later, the duo stumbled upon a hidden cave guarded by giant gumdrop sentinels (luckily on their lunch break). Inside, the air shimmered with Claus magic. There it wasthe Never-Melting Snowflake, glistening on a pedestal of ice. Twinkles eyes widened, 'Weve found it, Jangle! The key to infinite marshmallows!' As Twinkle reached for the snowflake, a voice boomed from the cave walls, 'One wish, you have. Choose wisely or face the egg-nog of regret.' Without hesitation, Jangle exclaimed, 'An endless supply of marshmallows for our cocoa!' The snowflake glowed, and with a burst of magic, marshmallows poured down, covering the cave in a fluffy, sweet avalanche. Back at the workshop, the elves were hailed as heroesthe Marshmallow Knights of Claus. They spent the rest of the season crafting new cocoa recipes and sharing their bounty with all. And so, under the twinkling stars of the northern skies, Twinkle and Jangle continued their adventures, their mugs full of cocoa, their hearts full of joy, and their days full of magic. For in the North Pole, every quest was a chance for festive fun, and every snowflake was a promise of more marshmallows to come.</p> <p>I then asked Chatty to modify the script to use the same ordering process, but combine the JPEGs into one Image. The result was the note with the correct serial settings.</p> <p></p> <p>Success!
