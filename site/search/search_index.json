This year's event, themed \"Snow-maggedon,\" offers an immersive adventure where participants sharpen their cybersecurity skills through engaging real-world challenges set in a whimsical holiday environment.</p> <p>This year, the challenge is structured into a Prologue and three Acts, each introducing new challenges and advancing the storyline:</p> <ul> <li>Prologue: Launched on November 7, 2024</li> <li>Act 1: Released on November 11, 2024</li> <li>Act 2: Scheduled for release on November 18, 2024</li> <li>Act 3: Scheduled for release on December 2, 2024</li> </ul> <p>Participants are encouraged to share solutions to the Prologue, Act 1, and Act 2 challenges starting once the next section has been released. However, for Act 3, players must wait until after the competition ends before sharing their answers or solutions.</p> <p>I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the SANS Institute and the entire Holiday Hack Challenge team for orchestrating this festive and educational event. Their dedication to fostering a global cybersecurity community through engaging and accessible challenges is truly commendable.</p> <p>This write-up aims to assist first-time participants, cybersecurity enthusiasts, seasoned professionals, and everyone in between. Whether you're seeking guidance on a particularly tricky challenge or exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity, I hope this resource provides valuable insights and support.</p> <p>Let's embark on this journey together, unraveling the mysteries of Snow-maggedon and enhancing our cybersecurity skills in the most festive way possible!</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>So far this write-up covers the just the objectives in the prologue. I shall include more content as I progress in the game and according to the sharing rules of the game.</p> <p>50-page submission limit</p> <p>Each year there's a huge number of write-ups that need to be reviewed by the Counter Hack team. To find a good middle ground between preventing information overload and creating a write-up that can stand on its own as a learning resource, some parts, like the navigation tip below, are collapsed by default. Skipping over these will not take away from understanding the overall solution, but feel free to expand them to get some additional information.</p> Navigation tip <p>Even with less than 50 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use P or , to go to the previous section, N or . to navigate to the next section, and S, F, or / to open up the search dialog.</p> <p>TL;DR if you keep pressing N or . from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! </p>"},{"location":"#answers","title":"Answers","text":"<p> 1.

And although we're on Frosty's Beach on Christmas Island, we'll soon be on our way back to the North Pole. I thought it best to wait here for people that heard we're on the Geese Islands but may not know we're leaving. I haven't seen Santa since we started packing up, but he always asks me to give a quick orientation to newcomers, so I'm continuing the tradition. Before you head out any further onto the island, you need to accomplish two simple tasks.</p> <p>But first, here's a parting gift. I packed this snowball made of the magical, never-melting snow of Christmas Island. A little souvenir to take with you when we leave for the North Pole.</p> <p>Click on the snowball on your avatar.

I'm Angel Candysalt \u2014 so happy to finally meet you! I'm thrilled you're here because I could really use a hand with something. Have you ever heard of a game called Connections? It\u2019s simple! All you need to do is find groups of four related words. I've been stuck on it all day, and I'm sure someone as sharp as you will breeze through it. Oh, and while you're at it, check out randomElf's score \u2014 they hit fifty thousand points, which seems\u2026 oddly suspicious. Think they might have tampered with the game? Just a hunch!</p>"},{"location":"objectives/o2/#hints","title":"Hints","text":"Elf Connect Easy <p>I love brain games! This one is like the New York Times Connections game. Your goal here is to find groups of items that share something in common. Think of each group as having a hidden connection or theme\u2014four items belong together, and there are multiple groups to find! See if you can spot patterns or common threads to make connections. Group all the items correctly to win!</p> Elf Connect Hard <p>WOW! A high score of 50,000 points! That\u2019s way beyond the limit! With only four rounds and a max of 400 points per round, the top possible score should be 1,600 points. So, how did someone get to 50,000? Something unusual must be happening!</p> <p>If you're curious, you might want to check under the hood. Try opening the browser's developer tools console and looking around\u2014there might even be a variable named 'score' that could give you some insights. Sometimes, games hold secrets for those who dig a little deeper. Give it a shot and see what you can discover!</p>"},{"location":"objectives/o2/#solution","title":"Solution","text":""},{"location":"objectives/o2/#easy-mode","title":"Easy Mode","text":"<p>To complete this challenge in easy mode, we can try and guess the groups, or do some research to learn what the members of each group should be. We could do this programatically via the browser console to be able to get the expected answers. The information is contained in the website's javascript, which we can read and understand. To be able to see the group sets for each section, we can run the code \"Display Correct Sets\" available in the code block. An easier way is to run code \"Automatically Select and Submit Correct Groups\" which will automatically submit the correct sets and complete the round.</p> <p>Success!

Investigating the code, we can see that the script is just submiting an action with a value of 1, when the round is completed succesfully, and a value of 2 when the high score is exceeded. There is nothing going to, or coming from the server that determines the high score. So all we need to do is set the score to 50,000 or more at the start of the game, and when we get the first matching set, we earn the gold trophy. </p> <p>Great Job Hacker!

For the most part, Elf Minder 9000 can be enjoyed without any hacking skills, offering a fun, festive experience. However, as the levels progress and challenges become more devious, a bit of holiday \"hacker magic\" might be just what you need to prevail. When the game becomes a real nutcracker, clever workarounds and some elven shenanigans are often the keys to success.</p> <p>Each level in Elf Minder 9000 has two scoreboards:</p> <ul> <li>Good Boss Mode     In this mode, players aim to finish the level with the least number of segments and in the shortest possible time. It rewards efficient and precise gameplay.</li> <li>Evil Boss Mode     This mode flips things on its head\u2014the goal is to take longer, pass through as many segments as possible, and make the fewest rotations. It's all about taking the scenic route and making the journey delightfully inefficient.</li> </ul> <p>Some of the more beginner-friendly levels, such as Sandy Start, Waves and Crates, Tidal Treasures, Dune Dash, Coral Cove, Shell Seekers, Palm Grove Shuffle, Tropical Tangle, and Crate Caper, can be completed without relying on any special tricks or hacks. They provide a great introduction for players of all skill levels.</p> <p>My eight-year-old daughter enjoyed playing Elf Minder 9000, and it was a joy to watch her enthusiasm grow. However, she quickly learned an important lesson\u2014sometimes, simply playing by the rules won\u2019t get you a place on the leaderboard!</p> <p>When we reached Shoreline Shuffle, it became clear that a bit of creative ingenuity was required. Digging into the code behind the scenes, we stumbled upon something interesting in guide.js. There was a constant called whyCantIHoldAllTheseSprings, which logs in the browser's console when the hero attempts to pass over three springs\u2014something that shouldn't be possible since the game only lets you use two springs by default. This clue led us to explore the game.entities.push() method, which, as it turns out, allows us to directly add objects into the game.</p> <p>With this newfound discovery, we realized we could place springs adjacent to boulders, a feat that regular gameplay mechanics would not normally permit. By leveraging these sneaky elven hacks, we successfully conquered Shoreline Shuffle. Here's what we ended up with for that level:</p> <p></p> <p>When passing the 3rd spring, we also saw this message in the browser console!</p> WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE SPRINGS?? <pre><code>                             WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE SPRINGS??\n\n                                            .--======-                                                          \n                                        --              --.                                                     \n                                    -=                     =:                                                  \n                                .=                         -
